title: "Selected methods of conducting and detecting of Web Scraping"
description: >-
  In 2024, I successfully defended my engineering thesis in cybersecurity. I'm genuinely proud of it, so I decided to share my work here. Additionally, I describe the writing process, the tools I used, and my key takeaways.

There comes a time in every programmer's life when we need to get out of our IDE and write a little more than a few lines of code.
For me, my engineering thesis was actually the first serious test in long-form writing.
A year after the defense, I maintain that I am proud of my work - so much so that I decided to share it in my first ever blog post.

The paper is titled **"Selected Methods of Conducting and Detecting Web Scraping."** and it's freely available [here on GitHub](https://github.com/tulski-thesis/thesis).

## Abstract

The paper focuses on web scraping — a technique for extracting information
from the Internet. Both the perspective of conducting the technique mentioned and
securing against it are included. The theoretical basis of web scraping, its practical appli-
cations and various techniques for conducting it are presented. This three-stage process
is described in detail: data retrieval, processing, and saving and presentation. Special
emphasis is placed on web scraping detection methods, including rate limiting, use of
reverse proxies with bot-blocking rules, and detection using browser fingerprinting. The
scraper and detection methods were presented as a case study, using a research platform
(an online store). The described and implemented detections were tested in various sce-
narios, both individually and in their combination. Attention was paid to the importance
of web scraping as a tool for effective data acquisition, as well as to the essence of effective
methods for its detection.

**Keywords**: web scraping, bot detection, rate limiting, reverse proxy, browser fingerprinting

## Write like an engineer

I used a combination of LaTeX and Git - as befits a future engineer.
The first took care of the professional appearance of the work (including the bibliography) and the second took care of version control and automation.
GitHub Actions automated PDF builds, making the latest version readily available to my supervisor via 'Releases'.
I highly recommend this approach.

## Final thoughts: tips for your engineering thesis.

Writing an engineering thesis is a big deal, but if you've got the right approach, it can be really rewarding.
Here are a few key things to remember:

1. Choose a topic that you're genuinely interested in. I chose Web Scraping because I had two years of commercial experience in it and it was something I was keen to learn more about.

2. Find the right tools for the job, like Git, LaTeX, and GitHub Actions, to make things easier.

3. Start early and stay consistent with a schedule, because procrastination is your worst enemy. If you're struggling with discipline, get some gentle (or not-so-gentle) motivation from your supervisor. I planned my work over ~25 days.
