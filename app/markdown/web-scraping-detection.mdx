### Abstract

The paper focuses on web scraping â€” a technique for extracting information
from the Internet. Both the perspective of conducting the technique mentioned and
securing against it are included. The theoretical basis of web scraping, its practical appli-
cations and various techniques for conducting it are presented. This three-stage process
is described in detail: data retrieval, processing, and saving and presentation. Special
emphasis is placed on web scraping detection methods, including rate limiting, use of
reverse proxies with bot-blocking rules, and detection using browser fingerprinting. The
scraper and detection methods were presented as a case study, using a research platform
(an online store). The described and implemented detections were tested in various sce-
narios, both individually and in their combination. Attention was paid to the importance
of web scraping as a tool for effective data acquisition, as well as to the essence of effective
methods for its detection.
